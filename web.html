<i><h1 style="text-align:center; border:2px solid Blue;">CURIOUS QUESTIONS</h1></i>
<br/>
<h2>1.Why can't bubbles be in the shape of a square or a rectangle?</h2>
<i><p style="text-align:center">Bubbles are round because there is an attractive force called surface tension that pulls molecules of water into the tighest possible groupings. The tighest possible grouping that any collection of particles can achieve is to pack together into a sphere(a round shape). Of all possible shapes - cubes, pyramids, irregular chunks - a sphere has the smallest amount of outside area, which means that it is the smallest shape to hold the volume of air and soap inside the ring of water. As soon as you release a bubble from your bubble pipe, surface tension makes the thin film of soapy water assume the smallest surface area that it can, creating a round bubble</p></i>

<h2>2.Why do we snore?</h2>
<i><p>You snore when air doesn't move as freely as it should through your nose and mouth while you're sleeping. Parts of your mouth and throat, including your tongue, uvula, tonsils, and so on. Vibrate as you breathe, creating the unique sound that we call snoring, There are many possible causes for snoring. Allergies can make your nose stuffy and cause you to snore. Cold and infection can cause snoring by blocking your nasal passages or making your tonsils swell.</p></i>

<h2>3.Why can't we open our eyes while sneezing?</h2>
<i><p>When you sneeze, you close eyes because of an involuntary reflex action. This means that your brain sends a signal to your eye muscles to close your eyes without you even thinking about it. Some people believe that the body may have developed this reflex to prevent irritants that are being expelled from the nose from getting into the eyes. Others believe that it is a reflex with no purpose. Some people can keep their eyes open while sneezing, but only if they put some effort into it.</p></i>

<h2>4.Why do cockroaches have white blood?</h2>
<i><p>The blood of cocroaches does not have haemoglobin, which is what gives human bood its res colou. This makes their blood appear white. Human beings use haemoglobin to carry oxygen. Cockroaches breathe in a different way. They use a series of tubes called trachea instead. Did you know that the blood of a female cockroach can appear to be slightly orange when she is carrying eggs.</p></i>

<h2>4.How does an eraser remove pencil marks?</h2>
<i><p>When you write with a pencil, graphite particles from the pencil rub off and stick to the fibres of the paper you're writing on. Erasers are made mostly of rubber mixed with a form of softener to make it more durable and flexible. When you rub the eraser across your page and over the graphite pencil marks, it creates friction, and this heat and movement loosen the particles within the graphite, lifting them from the paper.</p></i>

<h2>5.Why are our tongues pink in colour?</h2>
<i><p>The tongue is an organ, which means it is made up of many muscles. These muscles need the oxygen and glucose present in blood to work, so the tongue also has blood vessels in it. The pink colour of the tongue comes from blood running through these blood vessels.</p></i>
